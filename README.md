- 👋 Hi, I’m @p0zzle
- 👀 I’m interested in C, operative systems, AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on probably nothing! As at the moment I'm currently working on tiny projects for myself, mostly to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Probably through e-mail, tho I doubt you'll have any reason to do it. leon.collazo.are@gmail.com
